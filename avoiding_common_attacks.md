## Avoiding pitfalls, testing, and debugging

SafeMath.sol - Imported library in order to prevent integer underflow and overflows

Form fields - Controlling for user input to prevent poision data

JavaScript testing with "it" - Comprehensive tests to check state updates in smart contract

Msg.sender - Used in place of Tx.origin for deprecation purposes

Gas limits - Looping of arrays is not used in primary smart contract, in order to prevent gas limit issues
